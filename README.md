### **Blockchain**

Blockchain is a record-keeping technology designed to make it impossible to hack the system or forge the data stored on it, thereby making it secure and immutable.

### **Smart Contract**

Smart contracts are computer programs or protocols for automated transactions that are stored on a blockchain and run in response to meeting certain conditions.

Scripts means reading or viewing the data stored in the BlockChain. Scripts would not cost any money. Scripts do not modify the state of the BlockChain.

Transactions are the process of making changes in data on the BlockChain. A transaction would cost you money. Transaction modifies the state of the BlockChain.
